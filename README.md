## 1 Description 

Coffee Forest is a fictional website that sales expensive coffee from all over the continents of South America and Africa. This coffee goes through a (rigorous process) in order to be made. The process of course is fictional ðŸ˜‚ as you will find out in their descriptions but resembles some authenticity to how the real life process is somehwat created. 

### 1.1 Project Goals 

Create a website so that the user can search through various products of coffees and place an order for them. Have a shopping cart that allows the user to add their items to with the current total price. A login system for the user that will show their shopping history. 

### 1.2 UX

I decided to go with the color palette found on this image [COLORS](docs/img/color_palette.jpg) which was generated using [coolors](https://coolors.co/). This was possible using the home page image that I found on [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/assorted-decors-with-brown-rack-inside-store-683039/). From there I based the rest of the page on these 5 colors.
