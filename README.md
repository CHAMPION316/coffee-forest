# Background 

Coffee Forest is a fictional website that sales expensive coffee from all over the continents of South America and Africa. This coffee goes through a (rigorous process) in order to be made. The process of course is fictional ðŸ˜‚ as you will find out in their descriptions but resembles some authenticity to how the real life process is somehwat created. For the sake of fiction people are highly interested in this kind of coffee and how it tastes. 

# Mission Statement

To create an e-commerce application that will enable Coffee Forest to increase their customer base for their high-end online business. 

# Target Audience

The customers that use Coffee Forest are mostly those that love to drink coffee and want to expand their taste of coffee from the flavors they already know. The audience in this case are a small target willing to pay a premium in order to receive the best tasting coffee the market has to offer anywhere in the world.

# Stakeholder Interviews

## User Persona
Interviews were carried out with the owners of Coffee Forest, customers that already use the current service and customers who visited the website who were curious about the product. 

Ages between 18-23 were less likely to use the service but a growth among college graduates starting at 24-30 who found jobs upon graduation has given us an inline in purchases. What this is saying is that we are touching base with the younger crowd who have already grown a like for coffee and want to explore upon what more there is out there when it comes to purity and taste.

## Design Choices

### Fonts

* Content - Standard **Sans serif**
* Headings - [Josefin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans?query=josefin "Josefin")

### Colours

One of the main colours I wanted to have on my page was white considering how popular it is among many websites. From there I want colours that make people feel good when visiting a page.

The final decision was the following.

### 1.2 UX

I decided to go with the color palette found on this image [COLORS](docs/img/color_palette.jpg) which was generated using [coolors](https://coolors.co/). This was possible using the home page image that I found on [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/assorted-decors-with-brown-rack-inside-store-683039/). From there I based the rest of the page on these 5 colors. 

### 1.3 User Stories 

- As a user, I expect to navigate the website with ease of use.
- As a user, I expect to find products as seamless as possible.
- As a user, I expect to put the products I want in a basket. 
- As a user, I expect to type in keywords in the search bar to find specific products. 
- As a user, I expect to checkout after finding all the products I need.
- As a user, I expect have a login system in order to view my shopping history. 


##  2 Features 

### 2.1 Existing Features

All of my pages consist of the same navigation menu bar or hamburger icon for mobile devices. This format allows the user to understand where everything is located at all times for simplicity. The dropdown/menu will have options for 2 separate continents South America and Africa with countries within the continents. There you will have an existing choice of coffee products you can choose from. The option to add these items to your shopping bag is included as well. The items have a description a rating and a tag for their country of origin.
