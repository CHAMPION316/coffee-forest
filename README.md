# Background 

Coffee Forest is a fictional website that sales expensive coffee from all over the continents of South America and Africa. This coffee goes through a (rigorous process) in order to be made. The process of course is fictional ðŸ˜‚ as you will find out in their descriptions but resembles some authenticity to how the real life process is somehwat created. For the sake of fiction people are highly interested in this kind of coffee and how it tastes. 

# Mission Statement

To create an e-commerce application that will enable Coffee Forest to increase their customer base for their high-end online business. 

# Target Audience

The customers that use Coffee Forest are mostly those that love to drink coffee and want to expand their taste of coffee from the flavors they already know. The audience in this case are a small target willing to pay a premium in order to receive the best tasting coffee the market has to offer anywhere in the world.

# Stakeholder Interviews

## User Persona
Interviews were carried out with the owners of Coffee Forest, customers that already use the current service and customers who visited the website who were curious about the product. 

Ages between 18-23 were less likely to use the service but a growth among college graduates starting at 24-30 who found jobs upon graduation has given us an inline in purchases. What this is saying is that we are touching base with the younger crowd who have already grown a like for coffee and want to explore upon what more there is out there when it comes to purity and taste.

## Strategy
### Strategy Outline
The items are graded in a 0 - 5 system in both importance and feasibility as per the grading system below.

&nbsp;

| | Score - 0 | Score - 3 | Score - 5 |
|--|--|--| -- |
| Importance | Unwise use of time to address | Efforts should be made to accommodate these | Efforts MUST be made to address these
| Feasibility | Unwise use of time to address| Efforts should be made to accommodate these | Efforts MUST be made to address these

&nbsp;

The outcome is calculated by combining the scores from the *Importance* and *Feasibility* ratings. This then gives a final strategy rating of what items and where to focus on.

| | Score - 0 | Score - 5 | Score - 10 |
|--|--|--| -- |
| Item Description | Not viable | Efforts should be made | Efforts MUST be made

&nbsp;

# Marketing

Facebook is the main social platform being used to push Coffee Forest and it's popularity. The page has as very basic structure since adding more information to accommodate it's actual existence would probably get it shutdown by facebook. There is no address since this is an online shop only.

![Facebook Home Page](docs/marketing/facebook_image.jpg)

&nbsp;

I have also added 2 albums that includes the country and flavors for those coffees that the user can look at.

![Brazil Flavors](docs/marketing/brazil-flavors.jpg)

![Colombia Flavors](docs/marketing/colombia-flavors.jpg)

&nbsp;

I've commited to a post as well to show our audience one of our top fan favorites in order to capture their curiosity.

![Tarantula Post](docs/marketing/tarantula-post.jpg)


In the footer I have attached icons for other social media platforms. I did not create pages for the shop on these platforms since it was not needed but made links to their respective websites to demonstrate how it would look since almost every website has these.

* **[Facebook](https://facebook.com/)**

## Design Choices

### Fonts

* Content - Standard **Sans serif**
* Headings - [Josefin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans?query=josefin "Josefin")

### Colours

One of the main colours I wanted to have on my page was white considering how popular it is among many websites. From there I want colours that make people feel good when visiting a page.

The final decision was the following.

&nbsp;
![Colour Palette](docs/designs/the-coffee-colors.png)

&nbsp;

The colours will be used as described in the table below

| Hex Value | Root variable name |
| -- | -- |
| #FFFFFF | white |
| #C1D1C1 | light-green |
| #DEE0DD | light-grey |

&nbsp;

All of the desired colour combinations have passed the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ "WebAIM") and the results can be seen below.

| Colour 1 | Colour 2 | Results
| -- | -- | --
| light-green | light-green | [result](docs/designs/contrast-checker1.jpg "result")

# **Branches**

Branches were constantly used throughout the project. I constantly committed to Main Branch with broad descriptions of my commits. There was an instance where I was 2 commits ahead but I was able to fix that issue with the help of slack.

# **Features** 

## **Existing Features**

### **Navbar**

All of my pages consist of the same navigation menu bar or hamburger icon for mobile devices. This format allows the user to understand where everything is located at all times for simplicity. The dropdown/menu will have options for 2 separate continents South America and Africa with countries within the continents. The navigation bar is fully responsive to all screen sizes. There are other differences with the navbar depending on the user's login access:

#### Desktop Navbar

* The checkout page displays a table of the user's basket items and then the billing information form. This includes user details and address information. The full name, email and phone number and card number fields are all also required. There is also a checkbox option for the user to save their details, however, this is only available to users that are signed up and logged in.

![Details](docs/features/checkout/checkout-confirmation.png)

* The profile page allows the user, to update their default delivery information and view their purchase history.
    * **At the time of this writing I was unable to get the default information to stay saved on the profile**

![Profile](docs/features/profile/profile-details.png)

* The product management page is only for higher management users which can be givin those privileges in the admin panel. These users can add/edit/delete products themselves.

## Features to be Implemented

There are a few ideas that I would like to implement in the future:
* Login via social media accounts.
* Administration section to change a user to superuser status if say the user has been promoted.
* Ability to add a profile picture.
* Ability for the admin to see a list of all the users and adjust their access rights if required.
* Ability for rating system of the products to actually work
* Create different prices that correspond to the different sizes of the products.

## Code Validation
    - NOTE
    ```
    pep8online.com website is not working no more so I had to use the terminal for python code validation
    My mentor helped me to install pycodestyle in the terminal but that install caused a crash in the code where the website didn't function. In order to avoid disaster I decided not to use the requirement and remove it completely. The errors you will mostly see is **pyling erros** the rest is code that is needed for the website to function since vs code doesn't recognize django. I tried my best to make it pass validation but was not very knowledgeable on how to change the code in a way where it wouldn't crash. Everything on code validation is screenshot, so if there are errors they will be listed on there. No image means no error as you will see.

# Deployment

This project was created using GitHub and the code was written using Gitpod. Branches were created and after committing to the branch it was pushed up to the repository. This project is also deployed to Heroku, during its early stages, Heroku deployment was set to *Enable Automatic Deploys*, which meant that every time that the repository was pushed to, Heroku was updated also. However, Heroku encountered a security issue so automatic deployments were no longer available so the following deployment procedure was followed in the workspace terminal.

```
heroku login -i

Email: __enter_heroku_account_email__
Password: __enter_heroku_account_password__

heroku git:remote -a __your _heroku_app_name__

git push heroku main
```

The live link to the application can be found [here](https://swanbourne-village-stores.herokuapp.com/ "Link")

## Local Deployment

As Gitpod was the IDE that was used to create the project, the following local deployment steps are specific to Gitpod.

### GitHub
* Visit Github by following this [link](https://github.com/ "Link")
* Create an account or log in

#### Forking
* Navigate to the repository by following this [link](https://github.com/CHAMPION316/coffee-forest "Link")
* Click on the *Fork* button in the top right of the screen

#### GitHub Desktop
* Navigate to the repository by following this [link](https://github.com/CHAMPION316/coffee-forest "Link")
* Click on the *Code* button above the file list
* Select *Open with GitHub Desktop*

### Set up your Workspace
When you have your version of the original repository,

* In the terminal run
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
* In the root directory create a file called **env.py** and add the following content, the content of these, must match the Config Vars in the Heroku deployment section

```py
import os

os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = "FROM HEROKU DEPLOYMENT SECTION, DATABASE_URL CONFIG VAR"
os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = "FROM HEROKU DEPLOYMENT SECTION SECRET_KEY CONFIG VAR"
os.environ['DEVELOP'] = '1'

```

* Add the env.py file to the .gitignore file to ensure that its contents are not made public

* Migrate the database models with the following command in the terminal
```
python3 manage.py migrate
```

* Create a superuser and set up the credentials with the following command
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

* Run the application locally with the command
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

* To access the admin page using the superuser details just created, add /admin to the end of the URL.

### Deployment via Heroku
* Visit [heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/home "Heroku")
* Create a new account or sign in
* From the dashboard, select **New** and then **Create new app**
* Enter an individual app name into the text box, select a region from the dropdown and then press **Create app**
* A Heroku app has now been created and the **Deploy** tab is opened. 
* Open the *Resources* tab and in the search bar for *Add-ons* type *Postgres*
* Select *Heroku Postgres*, on the popup, ensure the dropdown is set to *Hobby Dev - Free* and then *Submit Order Form*
* Open the *Settings* tab and then click on the *Reveal Config Vars* button and the database_url should be populated.
* Fill out the rest of the config vars with the content of the table below by filling out the *Key* and *Value* and clicking on *Add* for each entry 

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| SECRET_KEY | Secret Key generated from [here](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/ "Shhh...")
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS | Password from Gmail authentication setup
| EMAIL_HOST_USER | Gmail account that will be used
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | From the stripe section
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | From the stripe section
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET | From the stripe section

* In the buildpacks section of the settings tab, click on **Add Buildpack**, select **python** and then save changes
* Open the **Deploy** tab
* In the deployment method section, select **GitHub** and confirm the connection.
* Enter the repo name into the text box and click **Search**. When the correct repo appears below, click **Connect**
* Return to the Gitpod workspace and in the root directory create a file called *Procfile*
* In the *Procfile* enter the following line including your project name
```
web: gunicorn YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.wsgi
```
* Add and commit to GitHub
```
git add .
git commit -m "commit message goes here"
git push
```
* Add your Heroku app URL to ALLOWED_HOSTS in your settings.py file
```py
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
```
* Return to Heroku
* In the Automatic deploys section, click **Enable Automatic Deploys**. This updates every time GitHub code is pushed
* To complete the process click on the **Deploy Brach** button in the Manual deploy section, this will take a few seconds to complete while Heroku builds the app
* A message will appear informing you that the app was successfully deployed and a **View** button will bring you to the live site


### Stripe
* Visit Stripe by following this [link](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register "Stirpe")
* And register for an account, for this project as it is only set up for test payments the *activate payments* section can be skipped.
* From the dashboard, click on the *Developers* and then on the lefthand side, *Webhooks*.
* Click on the *Add endpoint button* and paste in the Heroku URL with `/checkout/wh/` included on the end, for example, this project would be `https://swanbourne-village-stores.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`
* Add an optional description if required
* Click the *Select events* button and mark the checkbox for *Select all events*, then click *
Add events*.
* Scroll to the very bottom of the page and then click *Add endpoint*
* From the webhook page under the URL, reveal the Signing secret, this will need to be added to Heroku config vars as STRIPE_WH_SECRET.
* Still in the developer's section of Stripe, click on the *API keys* link on the left, the *Publishable key* (STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY) and *Secret key* (STRIPE_SECRET_KEY) will also be needed to be added to Heroku config vars.

# Credits
- I would like to thank my lovely wife for being there during this crazy year of up and downs especially when it comes to traveling for work which a lot of the time hinders my time with the course. I want to thank the team over at CodeInstitute especially Simen Daehlin for being a fantastic mentor and pushing me to meet deadlines. Everyone at Slack and the wonderful pages upon pages of information you find over at stackoverflow.com Big thanks to an old friend of mine nick named (Wheels) who is a programmer and helped me out for bits and pieces.

# My Thoughts

This was one of the hardest challengs I had to go through in anything I've done. Everyday I'm living with imposter syndrome when it comes to programming. The days that the code works I tell myself wait maybe this is possible. I mean if it was that easy everyone could do it. I'm a little sad for the things I could not add to the project and I have to admit that I struggle a lot trying to write code in python and js. I spent more time trying to break down code during this whole course than I can remember. I know it will come in time but I just don't feel like I'm quite there yet when it comes to writing really good code on my own.

\
&nbsp;

P.S. This is my second and last opportunity to send this reworked PP5 project. I did everything that was asked in the asssessment feedback to the best of my abilities and really hope to pass this course. This will get added into my last commit so I hope that it's read by whom reviews my project. I did the following:

- DEBUG= False
- Fixed CRUD operations (Which don't cause the 500 error page)
- User can login as admin and use CRUD
- CRUD also works as an admin from the UI
- Most code validations are pylint issues/ my inability to fix the rest is due to breaking the code and crashing my own site (my fear)
- Completely revamped the **issues** on github so they follow the MoSCoW method

Thank you, I now cross my fingers and leave this in your hands. 

Royer S.
